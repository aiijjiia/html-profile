                    <p>I remember playing Minesweeper and 3D pinball on my family's computer. I figured out a pattern regarding minesweeper, then I won every turn I played after that. I really enjoyed the sound and visual effects it creats when the ball hits the objects on each side in 3D pinball. The illustration and color choice is very engaging. </p>

                    I didn't know that Sara was going to become an architect if she is not designing. I thought she was going to do advanced research on psychology.
